        <h3>My Involvement in Hyperpop</h3>
		<p>As of writing this article, I have been learning to create Hyperpop music and playing around with pitches for vocals. I may not be good at it right now; however, it's a really fun genre (depending on which side of the genre you're on) with bouncy songs that will always make you jump to your feet and dance around to! When learning to make music, you usually would use different types of artists as inspiration since not all songs sound the same within the same genre. The artsits that I've taken a big inspiration from are brakence, ericdoa, and Charli XCX. I love the distortion from brakence's music, especially the constant glitches he puts on his vocals and transitions in the songs he creates. If I had to pick a song from him to reccomend then it would be <i>"teeth."</i> Ericdoa keeps his songs less distorted and has more of a trap type of beat, but his features he has in his songs and the overall vibe he carries really makes up for him. A good song from him would be <i>"hey there nice to meet ya."</i> Charli XCX is a new artist for me, but so far her songs has been giving me a light of bouncy ideas for melodies and chord progressions. She's more on the poppy side of Hyperpop and she does it really well! The song of choice for her would definetly be <i>"claws."</i></p><br>
